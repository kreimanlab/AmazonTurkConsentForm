## Why is this research study being conducted; What is its purpose? 
We are interested in understanding the mechanisms of visual object recognition. For this purpose, in this research effort, we aim to present images on a computer monitor and ask you to recognize, categorize, identify or memorize some of those images. In this research study, you will be seeing images containing single objects (e.g. faces, houses, cars, etc.), multiple objects, or scenes on a computer. You may also be asked to watch a short segment of a movie. In some cases, the images may be difficult to recognize. You will be indicating what you see by using a computer mouse or keyboard. There might be multiple testing sessions, each one lasting several minutes, with a pause screen in between. Throughout these measurements, we hope to gain insight into the mechanisms used by the brain to recognize faces and objects. 
## Who is conducting this research study, and where is it being conducted? 
The research is conducted at Children’s Hospital by a team of researchers headed by Gabriel Kreiman. 
## How are individuals selected for this research study? How many will participate?
Subjects older than 2 years old may participate in this research study. We hope to enroll up to 500 subjects in this study. 
## What do I have to do if I am in this research study?
The research study is very similar to playing computer games or watching movies. You would be asked to watch pictures presented on your computer display, to read words, or to watch parts of movies. You may be further asked to identify specific objects or characters, indicate whether you remember the objects. The responses would be by pressing a button (e.g. a computer mouse). 
## What are the risks of this research study? What could go wrong?
There is no risk incurred as a result of participating in this study. The level of risk is the same as the one in watching TV or playing computer games. If performing the tasks is uncomfortable, tiring or annoying in any way, the test can be stopped. You can pause and/or stop the test at any time if you feel any discomfort. 
## What are the benefits of this research study?
We are performing basic scientific research. There is no direct benefit to you for participating in this study. We hope to understand how the brain processes visual images. 
## Are there costs associated with this research study? Will I receive any payments?
There are no costs to you associated with this research study. You will be given monetary compensation for participating in this study according to what is listed on HIT information on Mechanical Turk. 
## What will happen with the information obtained as part of this research study? What about confidentiality?
All records associated with your participation in this study will be kept confidential. Results will not be placed in any medical record. Data are stored without identifiers. 
## If I do not want to take part in this research study, what are the other choices?
Participation in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to participate in the study by closing this expeirment. 
## Your privacy rights
If you do not want to participate in this study, you do not have to. If you do want to participate, however, you must agree to this form. If you do not agree to this form, you will not be able to participate or collect payment.
