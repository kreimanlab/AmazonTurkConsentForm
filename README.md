# Consent Form for Workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk

## Why is this research study being conducted; What is its purpose?
We are interested in understanding the mechanisms of visual object recognition. For this purpose, in this research effort, we aim to present images on a computer monitor and ask you to recognize, categorize, identify or memorize some of those images. In this research study, you will be seeing images containing single objects (e.g. faces, houses, cars, etc.), multiple objects or scenes on a computer. You may also be asked to watch a short segment of a movie. In some cases, you may be asked to wear special goggles or look at images through special mirrors so that we can show different images to your right and left eyes. In some cases, the images may be difficult to recognize. You will be indicating what you see by using a computer mouse, joystick or keyboard. There will be two test sessions, each one lasting 30 minutes. Throughout these measurements, we hope to gain insight into the mechanisms used by the brain to recognize faces and objects. 

## Who is conducting this research study, and where is it being conducted?
The research is conducted at Children’s Hospital by a team of researchers headed by Gabriel Kreiman.

## How are individuals selected for this research study? How many will participate?
Subjects older than 2 years old may participate in this research study.  We hope to enroll up to 500 subjects in this study.

## What do I have to do if I am in this research study?
The research study is very similar to playing computer games or watching movies. You/your child would be asked to watch pictures presented on a computer display, to read words, to watch parts of movies. You/your child may be further asked to identify specific objects or characters, indicate???whether he/she remembers the objects. The responses would be by pressing a button (e.g. a computer mouse). 

## What are the risks of this research study? What could go wrong?
There is no risk incurred as a result of participating in this study. The level of risk is the same as the one in watching TV or playing computer games. If performing the tasks is uncomfortable, tiring or annoying in any way, the test will be stopped. You can pause and/or stop the test at any time if you feel any discomfort.

## What are the benefits of this research study?
We are performing basic scientific research. There is no direct benefit to you/your child for participating in this study. We hope to understand how the brain processes visual images.

## Are there costs associated with this research study? Will I receive any payments?
There are no costs to you associated with this research study. You/your child may be given a token of appreciation and/or monetary compensation to thank you for participating in this study. Children will be given a token of appreciation. Adults will be paid $?? for participating.
